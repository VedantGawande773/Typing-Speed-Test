# Typing Speed Test

The Typing Speed Test website is an online platform that allows users to test and improve their typing skills. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

# Features: 

1. Typing Test: The main feature of the website is a typing test that measures the user's typing speed and accuracy. The user is presented with a random text passage to type, and the website records the number of words typed per minute (WPM) and the number of errors made.

2. Difficulty Levels: Users can select from different difficulty levels, ranging from easy to difficult. Each level has a different text passage, with increasing complexity and length. This allows users to gradually improve their typing skills and challenge themselves.

3. Timer: The website includes a timer that starts automatically when the user begins typing and stops when the passage is complete. The user can see their typing speed and accuracy in real-time, and the website provides instant feedback on errors made.

4. Results: Once the typing test is complete, the website displays the user's WPM, accuracy percentage, and the time taken to complete the passage. The website also provides a ranking based on the user's WPM, allowing them to compare their performance with others.

# How to Use

1. Select the difficulty level that suits your typing skills.
2. Type the text passage as accurately and quickly as possible.
3. Once the passage is complete, the website displays your typing speed and accuracy results.
